=head1 NAME

fasta2curview - generate output from fasta files for
use by the CurView project's web viewer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # output will be /path/to/file.json.

    fasta2curview /path/to/file.fasta;



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CurView project is a WebGL-based application 
for viewing curves. fasta2curview generates output 
for the application from fasta files for visual
inspection.

This uses the same library as our web interface
but may be simpler to use in cases where the 
CurView distrinbution can be loaded locally.
